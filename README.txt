To compile the shell do the following in terminal:

1) $ gcc myshell3.c -o myshell3
2) $ ./myshell3
3) Enter commands

OR

1) $ make
2) Enter commands

GUIDELINES:

1) Every argument must be separated by 1 or more spaces (except ';')

2) Allowed grep cmd syntax:
	i) grep (pattern) < (infile)
       ii) ... ... ... | grep (pattern)
grep can be used with other IO redirection and commands but above syntax must be followed...

3) Shell program creates temporary files (namely ".temp1" and ".temp2") for some of it's commands so make sure you dont have any such files in the project directory
